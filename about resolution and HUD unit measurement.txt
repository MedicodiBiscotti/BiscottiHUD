Always the same height (480)
16:9 ratio resolutions (such as 1920x1080) are 853 units wide
4:3 ratio resolutions (such as 1440x1080) are 640 units wide
5:4 ratio resolutions (such as 1024x819) are 600 units wide

640*(4/3) = 853
853*(3/4) = 640

To convert the HUD to 4:3 from 16:9 you downscale all XPOS and WIDE by (3/4). Subract (1/4).

In reverse, you add (1/3) to the width to upscale.
