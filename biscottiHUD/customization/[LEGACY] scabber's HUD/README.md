# scabber's HUD
v. 1.00

This is a customization for the old design of my HUD, from back when I went by the alias **sgt. scabberdaddle**. It's the ressurection of **scabber's HUD**!

Basically it's much, MUCH closer to the design of the stock TF2 HUD, so it's actually really simple to accomplish.

*Just delete all the hard work I've done for the past few years*

That's right, simply copy in the files in this folder and delete all the other files listed below from `biscottiHUD/resource/ui`.

* disguisestatuspanel.res
* freezepanel_basic.res
* freezepanelkillerhealth.res
* hudarenaplayercount.res
* huditemeffectmeter_killstreak.res
* hudmatchstatus.res
* hudobjectivekothtimepanel.res
* hudobjectivetimepanel.res
* hudplayerclass.res
* mvmbombcarrierprogresspanel.res
* mvminworldcurrency.res
* spectatorguihealth.res
* targetid.res

OPTIONAL:

* hudarenawinpanel.res
* itemquickswitch.res
* hudstopwatch.res
* mvmcreditspendpanel
* mvmcreditsubpanel
* mvmscoreboard
* mvmscoreboardenemyinfo
* mvmvictorycontainer
* mvmvictorymannupentry
* mvmvictorymannuploot
* mvmvictorymannuppanel
* mvmvictorymannuptab
* mvmvictorypanel
* mvmwavelosspanel
* mvmvictorysplash
* scoreboard.res
* hudtournamentsetup.res
* winpanel.res

To reset it back to the modern design the easiest way is to just re-download the HUD or keep a backup. This is because you simply just delete so many files, having all those files in backup would lead to a LOT of duplicate files that all need updating if something changes.
