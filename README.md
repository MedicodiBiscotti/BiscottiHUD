# biscottiHUD
This is my custom HUD for Team Fortress 2 (TF2).
I'd appreciate if you'd credit me for the HUD if you use it for pseudo-commercial uses like YouTube or Twitch.

#Installation
Click the button that says **Download ZIP**.
Then extract it to your /tf/custom/ folder so that inside your custom folder there is a folder called **biscottiHUD**.

#Customization
If you want to re-enable the HP cross when overhealed or low on health, navigate to **/resource/ui/hudplayerhealth.res** and remove the *NULL** at the end of the HealthBonudImage (both the name *AND* and "fieldName")

Inside /scripts/tf_hudanimation.txt will also find the animations for things like being overhealed or low on health and ammo.
There you can disable the box being coloured when in different states of health (i.e. overhealed).

You can also re-enable the shaded image that pops up on screen when disguising or picking of the intelligence.
This is done by uncommenting the respective lines at the top of the file.

#Credits
This is HUD is greatly inspired by BroeselHUD, e.v.e HUD, and 7HUD.
Thank you to all those people for making awesome HUDs and for making the code so readily available so that we all can learn how to realize our own ideas.

There is an alternate colouring for full Ãœber Charge that was taken from RaysFireHUD.
The Engineer buildings panel is HUGELY inspired by e.v.e HUD but tweaked and altered to my liking.

**Hope you enjoy!**
