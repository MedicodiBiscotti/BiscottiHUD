# biscottiHUD
This is my custom HUD for Team Fortress 2 (TF2).
I'd appreciate if you'd credit me for the HUD if you use it for pseudo-commercial uses like YouTube or Twitch.

As of right now, I don't have all the resource files included in this release, only the ones I've changed. Let me know if I should include all the files. That would make it easier to customize but much harder to update as more files have potentiel changes made and then you need to update them for no real reason as they weren't supposed to be changed anyway.

# IMPORTANT! Minmode
This HUD is a **minmode HUD**, meaning I designed it around using minmode (**cl_hud_minmode 1**).
But it also has a **non-minmode** version for people who like the HP and ammo to be higher up and closer to the centre. I personally don't like this and thus designed it in minmode.

To change between them use **cl_hud_minmode 0/1** where 1 is minmode, and 0 is non-minmode.
All the screenshots on huds.tf are in minmode (cl_hud_minmode 1).

#Installation
Click the button that says **Download ZIP**.
Then extract it to your **/tf/custom/** folder so that inside your custom folder there is a folder called **biscottiHUD**.

#Customization
If you want to re-enable the HP cross when overhealed or low on health, navigate to **/resource/ui/hudplayerhealth.res** and remove the **NULL** at the end of the **HealthBonusImage** (the **"fieldName"**).

Inside **/scripts/hudanimations_tf.txt** will also find the animations for things like being **overhealed** or **low on health and ammo**.
There you can disable the **box being coloured** when in different states of health (i.e. overhealed).

You can also re-enable the shaded image that pops up on screen when disguising or picking of the intelligence.
This is done by uncommenting the respective lines at the top of the file.

This HUD includes **multiple scoreboards** with tweaked sizes for **24**, **32**, **18**, and **12** man servers. (**Normal**, **32 man**, **Highlander**, and **6's**).

To change the scoreboard, copy the contents of the one you want to use into the one just named **scoreboard.res**.

I've included multiple copies of the **Main Menu** located in the **customization** folder. Three with custom design by me, and a pretty background, of which one  includes a separate **full button** with text for **Training**, the second uses an **icon** as a button for **Training**, and the third has the buttons lowered slightly.

Lastly, there's one menu that's a copy of the **stock** menu but with two extra buttons added. Of course, these extra buttons are in all the menus.

To change the menu, copy the one you want from the **customization** folder into **resource/ui/**. Note that the **customization** folder has those folders in it.

I've also included a **chat** file that uses a bigger font, and a set of **scoreboards** that have a bigger topbar.

To change those, use the same procedure as when described above.

If you want to make the font of the buttons smaller in the main menu, use a text editor like **notepad++** and replace **HudFontBiggerBold** with **HudFontMediumBigBold** in **resource/ui/mainmenuoverride.res**.

#Incognito
I've made an **incognito** mode designed for streamers that disables all names on the HUD. To enable it, copy the contents of the **incognito** folder into the parent folder (so that the folders match up). To disable it again, copy the contents of **backup_default_files** into the parent folder to overwrite the incognito ones. Note that I think custom weapon names still show up.

#Credits
This is HUD is greatly inspired by **BroeselHUD**, **e.v.e HUD**, and **7HUD**.
Thank you to all those people for making awesome HUDs and for making the code so readily available so that we all can learn how to realize our own ideas.

There is an alternate colouring for full Ãœber Charge that was taken from **SlinFireHUD**.
The Engineer buildings panel is HUGELY inspired by **e.v.e HUD** but tweaked and altered to my liking.

I took the RED and BLU buttons on the loadout screen from Ray (I think).

The main menu was inspired by WhiskerBiscuit's **budhud**. As was the concept of incognito to hide player names, but was of course implemented manually by me.

**Hope you enjoy!**
