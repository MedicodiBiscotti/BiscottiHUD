# biscottiHUD
v. 1.56e

This is my custom HUD for Team Fortress 2 (TF2).

I'd appreciate if you'd credit me for the HUD if you use it for pseudo-commercial uses like YouTube or Twitch.

# [^](#top "Back to Top")Compatibility
| Operating System | Compatible? |
|:----------------:|:-----------:|
| Windows | Yes! |
| Mac | Probably not. |
| Linux | No idea. |

| Resolution | Compatible? |
|:----------:|:-----------:|
| 16:10 | Yes! |
| 16:9 | Yes! |
| 5:4 | Maybe?.. |
| 4:3 | Yes! |

By compatible I mean that they work, not necessarily that it follows the design philosophy of the HUD. But at least there's nothing clipping out of the side of the screen.

# [^](#top "Back to Top")IMPORTANT! Minmode
This HUD is a **minmode HUD**, meaning I designed it around using minmode (**cl_hud_minmode 1**).
But it also has a **non-minmode** version for people who like the HP and ammo to be higher up and closer to the centre. I personally don't like this and thus designed it in minmode.

To change between them use `cl_hud_minmode 0/1` where 1 is minmode, and 0 is non-minmode.
All the screenshots on huds.tf are in minmode (`cl_hud_minmode 1`).

# [^](#top "Back to Top")Installation
Click the button that says **Download ZIP**.
Then extract it to your `/tf/custom/` folder so that inside your custom folder there is a folder called **biscottiHUD**.

# [^](#top "Back to Top")Customization
If you want to re-enable the HP cross when overhealed or low on health, navigate to `/resource/ui/hudplayerhealth.res` and remove the `NULL` at the end of the `HealthBonusImage` (the `"fieldName"`).

Inside `/scripts/hudanimations_tf.txt` will also find the animations for things like being **overhealed** or **low on health and ammo**.
There you can disable the **box being coloured** when in different states of health (i.e. overhealed).

You can also re-enable the shaded image that pops up on screen when disguising or picking of the intelligence.
This is done by uncommenting the respective lines at the top of the file.

This HUD includes **multiple scoreboards** with tweaked sizes for **24**, **32**, **18**, and **12** man servers. (**Normal**, **32 man**, **Highlander**, and **6's**).

To change the scoreboard, copy the contents of the one you want to use into the one just named `scoreboard.res`.

I've included multiple copies of the **Main Menu** located in the **customization** folder. One with a **custom** design by me, and one with the **stock** design but with two extra buttons added.

To change the menu, copy the one you want from the **customization** folder into `/resource/ui/`. Note that the **customization** folder has those folders in it. See the diagram below for a more detailed explanation of this procedure.

I've also included a **chat** file that uses a **bigger font**. There is also a version of the **winpanels** that use a **bigger font** for the team score.

To change those, use the same procedure as when described above.

If you want to make the font of the buttons different in the main menu, use a text editor like **notepad++** and replace `HudFontMediumBold` with **something else** in `/resource/ui/mainmenuoverride.res`

I've included two **colour schemes** for being **overhealed** and **hurt**. The current default one is **green/orange**, but I've included the option for the old **blue/red** theme which you might want to use if you suffer from **red-green colour blindness**.

There are tons of other customizations that I've added as I've made more significant changes to some design elements. Basically, whenever I made a big change, I included the old version as a customization.

Here's a diagram to show you how to enable customizations to the HUD.
```
| \tf\custom\biscottiHUD\
--------------------------------------
'-> customization
'	'-> [SPEC HP] cross
'	'	'-> **incognito**						**CTRL+A**
'	'	'-> **incognito_revert**				**CTRL+C**
'	'	'-> **resource**
'	'
'	'-> etc.									**Go back**
'												**Go back**
'-> incognito									**CTRL+V**
'-> incognito_revert							**Overwrite files?**
'-> materials									**YES!**
'-> resource
'-> scripts
```
In other words, mark and **copy (CTRL+C)** the elements inside the `customization` that you wish to use (i.e. the folders inside **[SPEC HP] cross**, then **go back two steps**, and **paste (CTRL+V)** to overwrite all the normal files in all the major folders with the new ones. This way the customization also applies to the incongito mode and the revert fomr incognito back to normal. See below. it follows the same procedure for enabling it as customizations do.

# [^](#top "Back to Top")Incognito
I've made an **incognito** mode designed for streamers that disables all names on the HUD. To enable it, copy the contents of the **incognito** folder into the parent folder (so that the folders match up). To disable it again, copy the contents of **incognito_revert** into the parent folder to overwrite the incognito ones. Note that I think custom weapon names still show up.

# [^](#top "Back to Top")Close Captions
The Close Captions were created by **Clovervidia** and edited by me.
To enable them, put this in your `autoexec.cfg`

```
closecaption	1
cc_subtitles	1
cc_lang			biscotti
```

If you want more thorough captions set `cc_subtitles 0`.

[Here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=167785751 "Clovervidia's Guide to CC") is a guide by **Clovervidia** that explains CC and how to use it.

# [^](#top "Back to Top")Credits
This is HUD is greatly inspired by **BroeselHUD**, **e.v.e HUD**, and **7HUD**.
Thank you to all those people for making awesome HUDs and for making the code so readily available so that we all can learn how to realize our own ideas.

There is an alternate colouring for full Ãœber Charge that was taken from **SlinFireHUD**.
The Engineer buildings panel is HUGELY inspired by **e.v.e HUD** but tweaked and altered to my liking.

I took the RED and BLU buttons on the loadout screen from Ray (I think).

The main menu was inspired by WhiskerBiscuit's **budhud**. As was the concept of incognito to hide player names, but was of course implemented manually by me.

The Close Captions were created by **Clovervidia** and edited by me.

A lot of README formatting inspired by Omni.

**Hope you enjoy!**

I also have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/SuperKavv "Medico di Biscotti on YouTube") that serves as a dump-site for the terrible, terrible videos I make from time to time. You can also see the HUD in action [here](https://youtu.be/cEWcqiAdATU "Tough Break update video") and [here](https://youtu.be/aZYaEZxbI-8 "HUD + name origin video"). The trailer uses an old version of the HUD, but the newer videos show the current one.
